Starting in Windows 8, the OS comes without the classic Windows 7 games. They are no longer included with Windows 11, Windows 10 and Windows 8.1. Here is a Windows 7 Games package which solves this issue. This Windows 7 Games package is compatible with all builds of Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.

It includes the following software:

Solitaire
Spider Solitaire
Minesweeper
FreeCell
Hearts
Chess Titans
Mahjong Titans
Purble Place
Internet Spades
Internet Checkers
Internet Backgammon

Windows 11 Support

The package has been updated to version 3.1. It now supports Windows 11 and fixes the error "Error opening file for writing: C:\Windows\System32\en-US\cmncliM.dll.mui". The non-working Game Explorer will no longer be installed. The installer now supports HiDPI displays. Finally, the Internet Games set is now optional, since Microsoft has turned off the game servers, making it nearly impossible to play them.

The support for older Windows version, i.e. Windows 8.1/8 and Windows 10, remains intact. You can use this new version of the package on older Windows versions too.
