### **1. The Vanishing Footsteps (Mystery)**
Emma lived in a small town where nothing ever happened—until the day she saw the footsteps.  

It had snowed overnight, leaving a pristine white layer over the streets. That morning, as she walked to school, she noticed a trail of footprints leading straight to the middle of the road… and then disappearing. There were no return tracks.  

Curious, she followed the path. It led to an old abandoned house at the end of the street. The footprints started from its front door, as if someone had walked out… and then vanished into thin air.  

Emma knocked, but no one answered. She pushed the door, and to her surprise, it creaked open. Inside, dust covered everything. It was as if no one had lived there for years—except for one thing.  

A single pair of wet boots sat by the door.  

Who had left them there? And why were they still dripping?

### **2. The Girl with the Golden Hair (Fantasy)**
Every year, on the first day of spring, a girl with golden hair appeared in the village. She never spoke, never aged, and by sunset, she always disappeared.  

Liam, a young blacksmith, had watched her since childhood, always too afraid to speak. But this year, he decided to follow her.  

As the sun began to set, she walked toward the forest. Liam ran after her.  

“Wait!” he called.  

She turned, her amber eyes filled with sorrow. “You shouldn’t follow me.”  

“Who are you?” he asked.  

She hesitated before whispering, “I am the spirit of the seasons. If I stay, spring will never end… and the world will fall into chaos.”  

Liam wanted to stop her, to ask more, but a gust of wind carried her away. And like every year, she was gone—until the next spring.

### **3. The Last Transmission (Sci-Fi)**
Captain Reyes floated alone in the silence of space. His ship, **Nova-9**, had been hit by an asteroid storm, and now, he was the last survivor.  

With his oxygen running low, he sent out a distress signal:  
**“This is Captain Reyes of Nova-9. If anyone can hear me… please respond.”**  

Minutes passed. Then hours. No reply.  

Just as he was about to lose consciousness, a static voice crackled through his radio.  
**“Captain Reyes… we hear you.”**  

His eyes snapped open. That voice—it was his own.  

Somewhere out in space, another version of himself was calling back.
